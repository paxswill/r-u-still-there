r-u-still-there (0.3.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Dynamic temperatures for rendering scale are now based on a moving average
    and have a minimum range applied.
  * Object recognition has been rewritten. Instead of a static threshold (the
    dynamic threshold was never implemented), a model of the background is
    built up and continuously updated. Non-background pixels are considered
    people once they've moved, and will continue be considered people until a
    configurable timeout is exceeded.
  * Log output no longer contains ASCII escape sequences when logging to a
    file.
  * MQTT connection handling improved, specifically when reconnecting.
  * The MQTT base topic is now configurable.
  * Melexis cameras can now be run at 0.5 FPS.
